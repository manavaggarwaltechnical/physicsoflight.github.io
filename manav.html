The Physics of Light</h2>
<p align="left">
Astronomers have a disadvantage in many respects because they are forced to 
observe the universe from a distance.&nbsp; That is, much of the information 
they obtain originates from data which is &quot;delivered&quot; to them from the distant 
corners of the universe.&nbsp; For example, they do not have the freedom to 
directly sample small pieces of a remote galaxy, an exploding star, or some of 
the planets (we are making some progress here).&nbsp; Much of the information 
astronomers get comes from the light and radiation the various objects emit into 
space.&nbsp; It therefore becomes very important to understand the nature of 
this radiation so we can dig out the clues it contains.</p>
<h4 align="left">
What is light?</h4>
<p align="left">
In the 17th century two great scientists, Newton and Huygens, argued this point 
(to no definitive conclusion).&nbsp; Newton argued that light was a particle and 
Huygens contended that it was a wave (much like the waves you find in water).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In 1801,
<a target="_blank" href="http://faraday.physics.utoronto.ca/PHY100F/young.htm">
Thomas Young</a> showed, conclusively, that light behaved like a wave.&nbsp; A 
little over a century later, quantum theory showed that light has properties of 
a particle.&nbsp; As it turns out, modern physics has shown that light does, 
indeed, have properties of both waves and particles.</p>

When Isaac Newton passed white light through a prism, it separated into a 
&quot;rainbow&quot; known as the <b>visible spectrum</b>.&nbsp; Since one color blended 
into another without any gaps, this has also been called a <b>continuous spectrum</b>.</p>

<h3>
The wave nature of light -visible light and the electromagnetic spectrum</h3>
<p>Light is a wave ... called <b>electromagnetic radiation</b>.&nbsp; It consists
of an oscillating electric and magnetic field that travels through empty space.&nbsp; 
This radiation moves incredibly fast in a vacuum&nbsp; ... 186,000 miles each 
second.&nbsp; The speed of light is designated by the letter <font size="5"> <b>c</b></font> 
and all the colors in the visible spectrum travel (in a vacuum) this same speed.&nbsp; 
What, then, distinguishes one color from another?&nbsp; One answer is the 
wavelength, designated by the Greek letter lambda - <font face="Times New Roman">
&#955;.&nbsp; This is the distance between successive wave crests.&nbsp; Red light 
has a slightly longer wavelength than blue light.</font><p>
&nbsp;<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="wave1.jpg" width="118" height="84"><center>
<p><img SRC="wavelength.jpg" width="195" height="192"></center>
<p>Red light (at one end of the visible spectrum) has a longer wavelength
than blue light.&nbsp; However, another way of distinguishing between the different colors of light is
by their <b>frequency</b>, that is, the number of waves that pass by a point
every second.&nbsp; The animation below is designed to show that red light
has a lower frequency than blue light. Imagine you were able to count the waves 
as they pass by the vertical line.&nbsp; Since both red and blue light travel at 
the same speed, you would find more blue waves passing the vertical line each 
second than red waves because the blue waves are closer together.&nbsp; </p>
<center>
<p><img SRC="lightwave.jpg" width="384" height="192">
<p>Red light has a lower frequency than blue light. (animation)</center>

<p align="left">The relationship between frequency (f) and wavelength (<font face="Times New Roman">&#955;) 
may be expressed in the following equation:</font><p align="center">
<img border="0" src="frequency.jpg" width="95" height="70"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">where <b><font size="4">c</font></b> 
is the speed of light.&nbsp; Notice that as wavelength increases, frequency 
decreases.</font><p>But there are waves with higher frequencies (shorter 
wavelengths) than blue light and waves with lower frequencies (longer 
wavelengths) than red light.&nbsp; These radiations are invisible
to the eye but exist in nature.&nbsp; Together they form the <b>electromagnetic
spectrum</b>.

<h4>Infrared radiation</h4>
<p>Just beyond the visible spectrum there exists electromagnetic waves which have 
slightly longer wavelengths than red light, and are known as infrared radiation.&nbsp; 
Although we can't see this radiation, we can feel it in the form of heat.&nbsp; 
On a warm summer day you can feel the warmth of the sun on your skin.&nbsp; This 
is coming from solar infrared radiation.&nbsp; Your own body radiates quite a 
bit of infrared radiation, which can be detected by &quot;heat scopes&quot;.&nbsp; This is 
often depicted on TV and in the movies where someone can spy on people in the 
dark with infrared goggles.&nbsp; One of my favorite movies, Predator, tries to 
convey the fact that the alien is adapted to view an infrared universe (not a 
visible one).</p>

<p align="center">Your instructor in infrared (an improvement over the visible 
one)</p>
<h4>Ultraviolet radiation</h4>
<p>With a wavelength just slightly shorter than violet, ultraviolet radiation is 
also invisible to our eyes.&nbsp; Everyone should be aware that the sun emits UV 
and that wearing UV blocker will protect you from this harmful radiation.&nbsp; 
All sunburns are caused by UV damage to your skin cells.&nbsp; In fact, you avoid 
any types of radiation with short wavelengths ... especially prolonged exposure 
to X Rays and certainly Gamma rays (how do you think the Hulk was made?)</p>
<h4>Some basic physics</h4>
<p>Here are some main points you need to understand: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Light behaves like a wave ... the color we see depends on the wavelength.
  <br>
  &nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>White light is actually all the colors of the visible spectrum combined
    <ul>
      <li>a prism can separate the light into the separate colors ... in nature, 
      a raindrop provides the prism to make rainbows. </li>
      <li>another device, called a diffraction grating can do the same thing.<br>
      &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.
    <ul>
      <li>red light has a wavelength of only .0007 mm. </li>
      <li>blue light has an even shorter wavelength ....&nbsp; .0004 mm. </li>
      <li>the width of a wire that makes up a paper clip is about 1 mm.</li>
      <li>red light has a lower frequency than blue light.<br>
      &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are
    <a target="_blank" href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html">other 
    wavelengths</a> of &quot;light&quot; beyond the range of our eyes (visible).
    <ul>
      <li>infrared, microwaves and radio waves have even longer wavelengths.
      </li>
      <li>ultraviolet, X rays, and gamma rays have very short wavelengths and 
      are dangerous to humans</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Making a continuous spectrum</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If a <b>solid</b> (or a compressed gas) gets <b>hot</b> enough, it will 
  convert some of that heat into light in a process is known as <b>incandescence</b>. In fact, it will emit a
  continuous spectrum of light (all the colors from red to blue) ... and 
  also some energy in the &quot;invisible&quot; infrared and ultraviolet.&nbsp; You can see 
  this for yourself by passing white light through a prism.&nbsp; A raindrop is a 
  natural prism which lets you see the spectrum of the sun as a rainbow.&nbsp; This 
  is kind of a &quot;brute force&quot; way of making light. </li>
</ul>

    </ul>
    <li>An incandescent light bulb uses electric resistance to produce heat 
    which makes light.&nbsp; Thomas Edison tried thousands of different 
    filaments which would stand up to the heat in his quest to invent the light 
    bulb.&nbsp; Actually an ordinary incandescent light bulb will emit quite a bit of 
    its energy in the infrared (IR) and some in the ultraviolet (UV).&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>A physicist named
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1918/planck-bio.html">
    Max Planck</a> laid down the theoretical framework for radiating objects.&nbsp; 
    He considered ideal conditions in which an object did not interact with 
    other matter and was in a constant state of equilibrium.&nbsp; In these 
    cases, he was able to show exactly how a perfect radiator would behave at any 
    temperature.&nbsp; This theoretical object was known as a <b>blackbody</b>.&nbsp; 
    Although nothing really behaves in this perfect state, many objects (like 
    stars) come very close, so much can be learned by studying the behavior of a 
    blackbody.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Below is a blackbody radiation curve similar to 
    the one produced by the sun.&nbsp; Note: 
    The outer sun (photosphere) is not a solid but a hot <i>compressed</i> gas 
    ... which also produces a continuous spectra.&nbsp;
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Radiation Curve of the Sun's Photosphere (a hot compressed gas)</p>
  </center>
  <p>Notice that the sun produces roughly the same intensities of all the 
  spectral colors.&nbsp; This is why the sun looks &quot;white&quot; to the eye ... (do not look 
  directly at the sun).&nbsp; Also note that the sun produces quite a bit of 
  radiation in the &quot;invisible&quot; ultraviolet and infrared. <br>

  <h4>Playing with Blackbody Radiation curves</h4>
  <p>I've found a great source on the web that lets you examine the radiation 
  curves of blackbodies at different temperature.&nbsp; Please spend some time 
  with it so you can discover some important properties of radiators.&nbsp; 
  If nothing appears below, please click on this

<img border="0" src="blackbody_directions_temperature_scale.jpg" width="340" height="253"></p>
<p> Please pay attention to two changes as you adjust the temperature - the 
overall intensity and how the &quot;peak&quot; shifts.</p>
<hr>
  <p>After playing around with the applet above, you will learn some important 
  properties of radiators. They are:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The hotter the object becomes, the more energy it radiates (per unit area) 
  each second. That is, intensity goes up (the curve gets bigger)... at every 
  wavelength. This has been summarized in a law known as the Stefan-Boltzmann 
  Law. It says that the energy output of a radiator increases as the temperature 
  increases according to this equation. (T is in Kelvin -see below)<br>
  <br>
  <img border="0" src="SB_equation.jpg" width="100" height="50"><br>
  <br>
  Simply stated, <b>the hotter, the brighter</b>!<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>As the temperature increases, the &quot;peak&quot; radiation shifts toward shorter 
  wavelengths. That is, cooler objects put out more radiation in the infrared. 
  Hotter objects put out peak radiation in the visible. Really hot objects 
  produce their maximum intensity in the ultraviolet. <br>
  <br>
  <img border="0" src="blackbody.jpg" width="494" height="271"><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>This has been summarized in a law known as <b>Wien's Law</b>.</li>
</ul>
  <p>
  <img border="0" src="Wien1.jpg" width="191" height="82"></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
  (T is in Kelvin -see below, &#955; is in angstroms )</p>
  <p>This also gives astronomers 
  a great way of determining exactly how hot&nbsp; a star's photosphere is.&nbsp; 
  By rearranging this equation, you find:</font></p>
  <p>
  <img border="0" src="Wien2.jpg" width="165" height="83"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All you need to do is scan 
  the spectrum of a star and determine  where it emits the peak radiation (&#955;<sub>max</sub>) 
  and apply the formula.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Example:&nbsp; An 
  astronomer scans the spectrum of a star (below) and maps the radiation curve 
  (shown in red).&nbsp; What is the temperature of this star's photosphere?&nbsp; 
  Measurements show that the star puts out the most radiation at 3986 Å.&nbsp; 
  Using Wien's Law, you find:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">T = 28,900,000 / 3986 = 
  7250 K</font></p>
  <p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="wien.jpg" width="497" height="270"></p>
  <p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;This also means that the color we see is a function of 
  temperature.&nbsp; Remember we can only detect the visible with our eyes, so we 
  are not &quot;seeing&quot; the whole story.&nbsp; Go back to the blackbody 
  simulator and choose a low 
  temperature around 3000K.&nbsp; 
  Now look only at the intensities in the visible.&nbsp; You will discover that 
  there is a lot more red light produced than blue light.&nbsp; This means we 
  see a cool star as red.<br>
  <br>
  Now try again with a higher temperature around 5500 K.&nbsp; You will discover that all the colors in the visible are 
  roughly equal in intensity.&nbsp; This is white light.&nbsp; Note: our sun is 
  considered a &quot;white hot&quot; star.&nbsp; It appears yellow because our atmosphere 
  filters out much of the bluer light.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Finally, crank the temperature up to 8700K or &quot;A&quot;.&nbsp; You will see that the 
  star puts out much more blue light than red, ... making it appear blue in 
  color.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p align="center"> <br>
  <img border="0" src="cold_hot.jpg" width="579" height="600"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cool stars appear <font color="#FF0000">red</font>, hot stars appear 
  <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>!</b>&nbsp; (So forget the 
  phrase &quot;red hot&quot;)</li>
</ul>
    <hr>
  
<h4>Kelvin temperature scale</h4>
<p>You may have been confused by seeing all the temperatures listed in K.&nbsp; 
What is a K???&nbsp; To honor Lord Kelvin, a temperature scale was created where 
zero point is <b>absolute zero</b>.&nbsp; Absolute zero is the coldest anything 
can get and it is very cold ... -460 Fahrenheit or -273 Celsius.&nbsp; Don't 
worry too much about this, but get used to seeing all temperatures listed in 
Kelvin.&nbsp; Deep space (space far from any stars) is very cold ..&nbsp; only 3 
Kelvin.&nbsp; You thought Wisconsin was cold?</p>

      <h4>Cosmic Rays</h4>
      <p>Before we finish this section, we need to toss in one more item - <b>
      cosmic rays</b>.&nbsp; Until now, all forms of radiation were 
      electromagnetic in character.&nbsp; That is, a wave of energy that can 
      travel through space at 186,000 mi/sec in a vacuum.&nbsp; Space is also a 
      host for high speed <b><i>particles</i></b> which can travel near the 
      speed of light, and under the right conditions, be just as deadly as large 
      doses of x-rays or gamma rays.&nbsp; Cosmic rays can consist of fast 
      moving electrons, protons (mostly), or even nuclei of helium atoms (known 
      as alpha particles).&nbsp; The source of these particles are extremely 
      energetic events (coronal mass ejections on the sun, exploding stars,
      bipolar flow from black holes, etc) ... but fortunately our magnetic field 
      and atmosphere acts as a shield (or buffer) from this &quot;buckshot&quot; from 
      space.&nbsp; <br>

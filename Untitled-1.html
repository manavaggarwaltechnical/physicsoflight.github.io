        physics is the greatest subjects i had ever seen.every phenomena has
        some explanationPhysics is considered natural science because it deals
        with the things like matter, force, energy and motion. As these all are
        related to task related to everyday life, so, we can say that physics
        studies how the universe works, how Earth Moves around the sun, how
        lightening strikes, how our refrigerator works and many more. In short,
        physics define how everything works around us. When cannot separate
        anything from science and, our world cannot disconnect itself from the
        wonders of Physics. When we look around us, we can see a number of
        things that work on the principles of Physics. We can explain our
        several activities by making use of the knowledge of Physics. Here, we
        will discuss some of the example, which will help us to learn how
        physics is playing its part in our lives each day. Walking A number of
        principles of physics are involved in simple act of walking. It involves
        concepts of weight, Newtonâ€™s three laws of inertia, friction,
        gravitational law and potential and kinetic energy. When we walk, we
        actually act like an inverted pendulum. When we put the foot on ground,
        it becomes our axis and our mass is centered in our abdomen, describing
        the shape of an arc. When we set foot on ground, we actually put weight
        i.e w=mg and apply backward force on ground, as the response to our
        weight, ground responds by an opposing force which is vertical in
        nature, on leg which slows us down and this slowing process continues
        unless our leg comes nearest to our tummy. When leg is moving, kinetic
        energy is at maximum and potential energy is zero, but, when leg reaches
        nearest to belly or arc, potential energy reaches to its maximum. When
        another step is taken, the stored potential energy is converted to
        kinetic energy and this process continues. We act as an imperfect
        pendulum, because all potential energy is not converted into kinetic
        energy. Only 65 percent of energy is provided by stored potential energy
        to take next step, remaining 35 percent is provided by bio chemical
        processes.
